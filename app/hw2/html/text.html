                <h3>The Problem With Writing About Soccer</h3>
            </header>
            <section>
                <p>It seems to me that there's a great deal of incredibly <em>sub-par</em> American soccer writing these days. 
                    It should really come as no surprise though, as many of us Americans <s>see through the corrupt farce that is 
                    FIFA</s> simply cannot appreciate the nuances of The Beautiful Game. The internet has enabled an even further decline of 
                    modern soccer writing: Looking at certain articles from <cite>Soccer Ipsum</cite>, we can see that some writers cannot even 
                    string together a coherent sentence: <q cite="http://soccer-ipsum.com">Four-four-two goalie one-two center-half striker midfielder UEFA European Championship World Cup yellow card chip number 10 goal ball referee forward African Cup of Nations. UEFA European Championship pitch ball midfielder World Cup chip soccer yellow card upper 90 center-half one-two four-four-two hat trick halftime goalie.</q> Simply horrendous! But what could be the reason for such drivel being published at the highest level? We should start our journey at the root.

                <h5>Fédération Internationale de Football Association</h5>
                <p>As the central governing body of soccer, <b><dfn><abbr title="Fédération Internationale de Football Association">FIFA</abbr></dfn></b> 
                    writes and enforces <strong>da rules</strong>. These rules even lay out the internal rules of the organization itself, for instance the rule 
                    concerning the roles and limits of the <i><data value="37">Audit and Compliance Committee</data></i>. The rules can be summed up by the simple saying
                </p>
                    <pre><code>
while(fifa_being_shady) {
    check_in();
    get_money();
}                   </code></pre>
                The committee is made up of <var>n</var> persons, where 2<sup>1</sup>&lt;<var>n</var>&lt;2<sup>3</sup>. When probed about their true purpose, the committee's robot overlords output
                    <pre><samp>To monitor compliance with the Compensation Rules.</samp></pre>. With dryness such as this, clearly the writing is rotten from the top down. 
                    If one wishes to verify the existence of these drab rules, they can navigate to <a href="http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/official-documents/law-regulations/index.html">The official FIFA rules site</a> and click on <kbd>FIFA Governance Regulations 2016</kbd>. There one can view any of the rules, from SS<sub>1</sub> to SS<sub>80</sub>. These rules are obviously the cause of the current <u>horrible</u> state of writing. Look again at the article quoted above: 
                        <blockquote><p><mark>UEFA</mark> European Championship pitch ball midfielder <mark>World Cup</mark></p></blockquote> Even UEFA is on on FIFAs World Cup schemes! The writing is on the wall.
                <p>Maybe switching to a different language will help. Why not, for example, use 
                    <ruby>
                        <rb>踢</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>Tī</rt><rp>)</rp>
                        <rb>足</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>zú</rt><rp>)</rp>
                        <rb>球</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>qiú</rt><rp>)</rp>
                    </ruby> when writing articles? In fact, we could use all sorts of different languages to help bump up our writing prowess.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><bdi>足球</bdi>: Mandarin Chinese (traditional)</li>
                    <li><bdo dir="rtl">كرة القدم</bdo>: Arabic</li>
                    <li><bdi>fútbol</bdi>: Spanish</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Of course, perhaps since soccer is a rather silly game after all we are better off just writing gibberish altogether: Four-four-twogoalieone-twocenter-halfstrikermidfielder<wbr>UEFAEuropeanChampionshipWorldCup<wbr>yellowcardchipnumber10goalballrefereeforwardAfricanCupofNations.<wbr>UEFAEuropeanChampionshippitchballmidfielderWorldCup<wbr>chipsocceryellowcardupper90center-halfone-twofour-four-twohattrickhalftimegoalie.
