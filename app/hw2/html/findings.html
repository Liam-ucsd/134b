  <ol reversed>
    <li>In an article, an h1 is the same size as an h2</li>
    <li>It is invalid to have an h1 tag in an article. If you do this the
        validator gives a warning. You should use h2-h6 tags.</li>
    <li>Despite being part of w3c's HTML5 specifications, the <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> tag is not supported by all browsers</li>
    <li>Images must have an <code>alt</code> attribute. This is not considered optional or an accessibility feature.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag have the same effect on the web browsers.
      <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag are explicit. <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag are semantic. </li>
    <li><code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tags without a <code>name</code> attribute will not send their data when their parent form is submitted. However, they are still valid HTML tags and errors can slip under the radar this way.</li>
    <li>The <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tag will by default act as a submission button. This can be avoided by explicitly setting the <code>type</code> attribute to some other legal value. Interestingly, both the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tags behave the same when using the <code>type="button"</code> attribute.</li>
    <li>If you use a javascript function with the same name as your html event handler attribute it will not work. For example if you want to handle an onblur event with a function called onblur() or blur() it won't work.
      But this seems to be case sensitive as well ie Blur() and onBlur() seems to work fine.</li>
    <li>If you handle an onfocus event with an alert it will continuously fire the event, such that you get that same alert continuously.</li>
