            <h4>Is Soccer Art?</h4>
            <p>Thanks to the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag, the art of soccer can easily be appreciated. 
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps not everyone agrees with the assessment that 'soccer is art.' 
                Fear not! It is quite easy to support such a claim. Consider the following quote from Soccer Ipsum: 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Look At It Again, It's Simple Perfection!"
            </blockquote>
            <p>What, other than art, could elicit such raw human emotion? What indeed? 
                Still, if you remain unconvinced then look no further than the results of our own in-house research. 
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Results of Decades of Research Regarding Soccer as Art</h4>
            <h5>List of Artistic Sports</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Soccer</li>
                <li>Free Solo Rock Climbing</li>
                <li>Olympic Ribbon Dancing</li>
                <li>Synchronized Swimming</li>
                <li>Speed Painting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, there's no doubt that with the exception of speed painting most artistic sports 
                are quite niche. But further research gave us this ranking of most popular sports: 
            </p>
            <h5>List of Most Popular Sports in the Entire Universe</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Soccer</li>
                <li>Football</li>
                <li>Association Football</li>
                <li>Footy</li>
                <li>Futbol</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So not only is soccer one of the most artistic sports in the world, but it also takes 
                all 5 of the most popular spots as well! Such a large sample size allows us to make our claims 
                with complete conviction. But if you're more of a visual learner than a math-er, we've got more 
                figures to back up our assertions.
            </p>

            </dl>
            <p>A simple 'spot the difference' task will illustrate the true fact that soccer and art are nearly indistinguishable. 
                but if you seem to struggle even with this amount of visual data, perhaps we can simplify things further:
